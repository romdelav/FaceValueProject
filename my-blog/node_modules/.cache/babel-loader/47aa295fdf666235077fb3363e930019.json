Falsely identified as the suspect by Michigan State Police's \n            face recognition software, he spent a total of 30 hours in detention. Charges were dismissed once investigators \n            realized that “the computer got it wrong,” making this incident the first wrongful arrest in the U.S. due to a \n            facial recognition mismatch.`, `Since its early days, facial recognition has raised questions among privacy advocates and ethics watchdogs who have \n            repeatedly warned against data collection, processing, and storage methods as well as unregulated use of the technology. \n            William’s story brought to light yet another – and perhaps more radical – set of concerns: just how reliable is facial \n            recognition to begin with? Could William's story be yet another example of what many have described as \n            'racial bias' in facial biometric systems.`, `Social psychologists agree that humans tend to perceive faces of their own race more acutely than those of other races. \n            Referred to as “cross-race effect” or “other-race effect,” this phenomenon has been supported by a large corpus of evidence.\n            Some hypotheses suggest that the amount of exposure to and experience with a specific race group is correlated with the ability \n            to recognize individuals from that group. Could this hypothesis explain how some systems struggle to identify people of color, especially \n            women? According to the 2018 “Gender Shades” project, algorithms developed by Microsoft, Amazon, and IBM, among others, yielded \n            disconcerting results. Darker-skinned women were over 34% more likely to be misidentified than light-skinned men. This begs \n            the question: how can something as inherently human as perceptual bias be embedded in code?`, `Nowadays, facial recognition systems rely on machine-learning frameworks to train complex algorithms by feeding them large \n            image datasets. Those images are generally categorized by age, gender, skin tone, and many other metrics. The \n            more an algorithm is fed images of diverse faces, the more proficient it becomes in identifying those faces. One \n            explanation that has been advanced to account for the racial bias of facial recognition systems may therefore have to do with low public availability of diverse \n            datasets – those are indeed quite rare. A consequence of this shortage is to encode the other-race effect directly into \n            the software application layer as algorithms struggle to recognize faces that they have been less exposed to.`, `If performance bias does stem from a lack of representation in data, then what are companies and organizations doing to \n            address it? In January, IBM decided to publicly release a database of a million faces that better reflect the variety \n            of skin tones found in the real world. Named “Diversity in Faces,” this massive dataset was meant “to advance the study \n            of fairness and accuracy in facial recognition technology.” However, IBM’s initiative quickly backfired when NBC News \n            journalist Olivia Solon revealed that many of those images were collected from the photo-hosting site Flickr without proper consent. \n            While IBM guaranteed users that they could opt out of the database, doing so proved very difficult. Indeed, IBM required them \n            to email links to the images they wanted removed, but never publicly shared the list of Flickr users whose photos were included in \n            the dataset. In the wake of this controversy and as Black Lives Matter protests erupted all over the country following George\n            Floyd’s death, IBM ultimately decided to abandon its facial recognition research program, hinting that the fastest way to get rid of \n            facial recognition bias was to get rid of facial recognition altogether.`, `But not everyone gave up on improving the technology. Innovative methods have been developed to reduce bias occurrences without infringing on privacy \n            rights, such as per-subject adversarially-enabled data augmentation. This approach uses generative adversarial network (GAN) to transfer \n            racial attributes of a human face while preserving individual identity features. This makes it possible to produce different \n            versions of the same face across multiple race groups, thus increasing the diversity of dataset images. In other words, \n            adversarially-enabled data augmentation attempt to mitigate bias at the pre-processing level (data preparation) by creating \n            fair datasets.`, `Another way to address some of the issues that have plagued facial recognition was suggested by James Tate, a member of Detroit’s \n            city council, in a recent interview for the New York Times. This past November, Tate voted to approve a contract extension for the \n            facial recognition software that had misidentified Robert Williams earlier this year, arguing that some of the technology’s \n            flaws can be overcome through regulatory policy. While Tate knows that this solution is not ideal, he also wants to reframe \n            the narrative on facial recognition: its success in solving cases should not overshadow the few incidents that occurred along the \n            way. According to him, efficient checks and balances have been implemented following William’s wrongful arrest. Those include requiring \n            multiple approvals, limiting the use of facial recognition to serious crimes, and being supervised by a civilian oversight board.\n            Many, however, are still perplexed.`, `Celebrated by some as a powerful tool of law enforcement, berated by others as a dangerous instrument of profiling, facial recognition \n            has elicited mixed, if not polarized responses. Those have compelled experts to reassess not just the conditions in which it should used, \n            but whether it should be used at all given its current limitations.
