year, Robert Williams, 42, was arrested on suspicion of stealing watches from a trendy Shinola \r\n            retail store he had not patronized in years. Falsely identified as the suspect by Michigan State Police's \r\n            face recognition software, he spent a total of 30 hours in detention. Charges were dismissed once investigators \r\n            realized that “the computer got it wrong,”<a className=\"referenceLink\" href=\"#1\">[1]</a> making this incident \r\n            the first wrongful arrest in the U.S. due to a facial recognition mismatch.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>Since its early days, facial recognition has raised questions among privacy advocates and ethics watchdogs who \r\n            have repeatedly warned against data collection, processing, and storage methods as well as unregulated use of \r\n            the technology. William’s story brought to light yet another – and perhaps more radical – set of concerns: just \r\n            how reliable is facial recognition to begin with? Can it be trusted at all? Long before his arrest, some scholars \r\n            had already exposed what they described as racial bias in facial biometric systems.<a className=\"referenceLink\" \r\n            href=\"#2\">[2]</a> In what follows, I will draw on corpus of tweets, newspaper articles, and scholarly essays to \r\n            unpack this notion, identify its origins, and discuss recent efforts to correct it. I will be using the term “race” \r\n            instead of “ethnicity” to align with the terminology adopted in academic studies. \r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>Social psychologists agree that humans tend to perceive faces of their own race more acutely than those of other \r\n            races. Referred to as “cross-race effect” or “other-race effect,” this phenomenon has been supported by a large \r\n            corpus of evidence.<a className=\"referenceLink\" href=\"#3\">[3]</a> Some hypotheses suggest that the amount of exposure \r\n            to and experience with a specific race group is correlated with the ability to recognize individuals from that group. \r\n            This may very well explain how some systems struggle to identify people of color, especially women. According to the \r\n            2018 “Gender Shades” project, algorithms developed by Microsoft, Amazon, and IBM, among others, yielded disconcerting \r\n            results.  Darker-skinned women were over 34% more likely to be misidentified than light-skinned males.<a className=\"referenceLink\" \r\n            href=\"#4\">[4]</a> This begs the question: how can something as inherently human as perceptual bias be embedded in code? \r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n            <br/><br/>\r\n            <img src={figure3} alt=\"cannot display\" className=\"figure3\"/>\r\n            <br/><br/>\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>Nowadays, facial recognition systems rely on machine-learning frameworks to train complex algorithms by feeding \r\n            them large image datasets. Those images are generally categorized by age, gender, skin tone, and a variety of \r\n            other metrics. The more an algorithm is fed images of diverse faces, the more proficient it becomes in identifying \r\n            those faces. One possible explanation for the racial bias of facial recognition systems may thus have to do with \r\n            low public availability of diverse datasets – those are indeed quite rare. A consequence of this shortage is to \r\n            encode the other-race effect directly into the software application layer as algorithms struggle to recognize faces \r\n            that they have been less exposed to. \r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>If indeed performance bias stems from a lack of representation in data, then what are companies and organizations \r\n            doing to address it? In January, IBM decided to publicly release a database of a million faces that better reflect \r\n            the variety of skin tones found in the real world. Named “Diversity in Faces,” this massive dataset was meant “to \r\n            advance the study of fairness and accuracy in facial recognition technology.”<a className=\"referenceLink\" href=\"#5\">\r\n            [5]</a>  However, IBM’s initiative quickly \r\n            backfired when NBC News journalist Olivia Solon revealed that many of those images were collected from the \r\n            photo-hosting site Flickr without consent. While IBM guaranteed users that they could opt out of the database, \r\n            doing so proved very difficult. Indeed, IBM required them to email links to the images they wanted removed, but \r\n            never publicly shared the list of Flickr users whose photos were included in the dataset.<a className=\"referenceLink\" \r\n            href=\"#6\">[6]</a> In the wake of this controversy and as Black Lives Matter protests erupted all over the country \r\n            following George Floyd’s death, IBM ultimately decided to abandon its facial recognition research program, implying \r\n            that the only way to get rid of facial recognition bias was to get rid of facial recognition altogether.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n            <br/><br/>\r\n            <img src={figure1} alt=\"cannot display\" className=\"figure1\"/>\r\n            <br/><br/>\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>But not everyone gave up on improving the technology. In March of this year, a group of computer scientists and \r\n            engineers at the University of Durham, England, proposed an innovative method to reduce bias occurrences without \r\n            infringing on privacy rights: per-subject adversarially-enabled data augmentation. What this approach does is use \r\n            generative adversarial network (GAN) to transfer racial attributes of a human face while preserving identity \r\n            features. This makes it possible to produce different versions of the same face across multiple race groups, thus \r\n            increasing the diversity of dataset images. In other words, adversarially-enabled data augmentation attempt to \r\n            mitigate bias at the pre-processing level (data preparation) by creating fair datasets. While accuracy gains were \r\n            made, they seemed minimal and only went up by 1%. Could it be that GAN, a fairly new technology that was developed \r\n            in 2014, may itself need further correction?\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n            <br/><br/>\r\n            <img src={figure2} alt=\"cannot display\" width=\"100%\" />\r\n            <br/><br/>\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>All in all, each of the solutions discussed above offer their own advantages and drawbacks. IBM was one of the first \r\n            to officially dismiss the technology as deeply flawed due to ethical and privacy concerns. Not only did the company \r\n            deem it complicit in enacting new modes of racial profiling, but accessing diverse datasets proved challenging \r\n            without violating privacy rights. Yet not everybody has ditched facial recognition. In an attempt to address these \r\n            issues, a team of UK researchers is currently leveraging the power of GAN. These polarized responses underscore the \r\n            divisive, controversial nature of the technology and have compelled experts to reassess not just the conditions in \r\n            which it is currently used, but whether it should be used at all given its limitations. Answering these questions is \r\n            urgent. Until then, other Robert Williams will most likely suffer the consequences.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br/><br/><br/><br/>\r\n        <div className=\"references\">\r\n            <h3>References</h3>\r\n            <br/><br/>\r\n            <a className=\"referenceLink\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/technology/facial-recognition-arrest.html\" \r\n            name=\"1\">[1] https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/technology/facial-recognition-arrest.html\r\n            </a>\r\n            <br/><br/> \r\n            <a className=\"referenceLink\" href=\"https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JICES-05-2018-0050/full/html\" \r\n            name=\"2\">[2] https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JICES-05-2018-0050/full/html\r\n            </a>\r\n            <br/><br/>\r\n            <a className=\"referenceLink\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3496291/\" name=\"3\">\r\n               [3] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3496291/\r\n            </a>\r\n            <br/><br/>\r\n            <a className=\"referenceLink\" href=\"http://gendershades.org/overview.html\" name=\"4\">[4] http://gendershades.org/overview.html\r\n            </a>\r\n            <br/><br/>\r\n            <a className=\"referenceLink\" href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2019/01/diversity-in-faces/\" name=\"5\">\r\n                [5] https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2019/01/diversity-in-faces/ \r\n            </a>\r\n            <br/><br/>\r\n            <a className=\"referenceLink\" href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2019/01/diversity-in-faces/\" name=\"6\">\r\n                [6] https://nbcnews.to/3oJNmVH \r\n            </a>\r\n\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    \r\n</div>\r\n    \r\n</> \r\n);\r\n\r\nexport default HomePage;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
